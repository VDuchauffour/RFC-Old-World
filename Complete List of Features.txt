AI BEHAVIOR
* Conquerors will attack native cities immediately
* Some civilizations (e.g. Arabia, Mongolia, Turkey) fight their initial wars longer and more aggressively
* Reduced intervals between early AI wars
* Beyond declarations of war, AI war maps also influence which cities it tries to capture
* AI war maps also influence which independent cities are targeted
* Discouraged Seljuk and Mongol conquerors from razing cities in the Middle East
* It is harder for far away civilizations to become worst enemies
* Cities will not be founded on food resources anymore
* Classical leaders monopolize less to enable more tech trade in that era
* War and peace with minor civilizations is disregarded when considering to become a vassal
* Minor civilizations will not use nuclear weapons
* Maps are generally less valuable in trades
* You will only be asked to join a war if you share a border with the target
* AIs are willing to trade away their last resource or corporation resources if the trade is otherwise favorable
* AI resource value judgment now includes the overall benefit they or their trade partner receive from a resource, including number of cities

BALANCE
* Several classical wonders are prevented from being built in later eras
* China cannot trade techs it has a monopoly on to reduce the benefit of its UP
