## Overview

Rhye's and Fall of Civilization is one of the most popular mods for Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword.

Rhye's and Fall intends to turn Civilization into a history simulator: the game is played on a realistic map of the world, civilizations start at historically accurate dates, the AI is encouraged to behave historically, and players can win the games by completing their historical victory.
